Cleaning data 

the project requires the data downloaded from the url to undergo run_analysis.R, which does the following-

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a data set named tidy.txt
